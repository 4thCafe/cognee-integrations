"""The only_context contract after SDK-904: graph context only, guidance apart.

An ``only_context`` completion recall on cognee >= 1.6.0 returns ONE item per
dataset whose ``text`` is the full LLM input the completion would have received.
Sent WITH a session id that string opens with the session's last ten Q&A pairs
in full — the agent's own previous turns, which already sit in its context
window — and it is wrapped in the question template meant for cognee's own LLM.
So the prompt hook now:

  * sends the graph-scope request WITHOUT the session id, so no history comes
    back, and cuts the question template away (``_recall_text``), injecting
    only the retrieved context, shrunk (own-session passages dropped, passages
    capped, empty entity bullets pruned) under ``=== Cognee memory ===``;
  * sends a second, parallel ``session_context`` request WITH the session id
    for the server-rendered guidance block, injected under
    ``=== Active agent guidance ===``;
  * injects an item it cannot parse (a pre-1.6.0 bare context, an unknown
    template) whole — fail-open — and logs ``recall_context_unparsed``;
  * keeps ``counts`` on all five keys, with ``per_scope`` listing what was
    dispatched: ``graph`` and ``session_context``.

All registered suites carry the contract identically, so all are exercised.
